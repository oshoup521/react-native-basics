## Introduction

React Native is a popular framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows you to create natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android using a single codebase.

## Getting Started

To get started with React Native, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow the official [React Native Getting Started guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to install the necessary tools and create your first React Native project.

## Basic Components

### Text

The `Text` component is used to display text in your app. It supports various styles and touch handling.

### View

The `View` component is a container for other components and can be used to style and layout child components.

### Image

The `Image` component is used to display images, either from local resources or from a URL.

### TextInput

The `TextInput` component is used to create text input fields, allowing users to enter text.

### Button

The `Button` component is used to create buttons for user interactions, such as submitting forms or navigating to different screens.

## Styling

In React Native, you can style components using JavaScript objects or stylesheets, similar to CSS in web development. Styles can be applied inline or through a `StyleSheet` object.

## State and Props

React Native uses state and props to manage and pass data within components. State is used to handle data that changes over time, while props are used to pass data from parent to child components.

## Handling Events

You can handle various events in React Native, such as button presses, text input changes, and touch events, to create interactive applications.

## Navigation

To navigate between different screens in your app, you can use libraries like React Navigation, which provides a robust navigation solution for React Native apps.

## Debugging

React Native provides several tools for debugging, including the React Developer Tools and the React Native Debugger. Use the [official documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging) for more information.
